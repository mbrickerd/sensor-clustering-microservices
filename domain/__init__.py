"""
Domain models package for the Sensor Failure Detection System.

This package provides the core data models used across all microservices in the
Sensor Failure Detection System. It serves as a single source of truth for
database schema definitions and ensures consistency across the distributed
application architecture.

The package is designed to be installed as a shared dependency in all
microservices, enabling direct imports from domain.models and providing
type-checking support via the py.typed marker.
